This directory contains a small test-program that I (Joachim Pileborg)
use to test libspotify and its API. It is written in C++ and utilises
the brand new C++11 standard. That means it needs at least version 4.5
of the GCC C++ compiler, and is in fact developed using version 4.6.

This test-program also is a test of using the ALSA API to actually play
the tracks we receive from libspotify.
