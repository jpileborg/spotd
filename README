The Spotify daemon is an application that runs in the background, and
behaves just like the normal Spotify client, but without any user
interface. Instead the daemon is controlled though a set of shell-scripts
that wites and reads commands to and from a special connection. This way
it will be easy to embed status-icons or controls in other programs. It
will even be possible to write a completely new graphical user interface
instead of the default.

Well, that is the goal anyway. Now I just have to code this! :)
